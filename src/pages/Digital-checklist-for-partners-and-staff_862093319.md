If you’re with an agency, a freelancer or member of Shelter’s staff, this page lists things to consider about the way we work and Shelter's requirements throughout the [product development process](https://design.shelter.org.uk/digital-framework/Creating-a-live-service.839745537.html).

**Checklist**
-------------

### **Before you begin:**

*   To deliver most effectively and make good use of our budget, it’s important to identify alignment with organisation goals and other plans. Have you aligned your work (where possible) with our [anti-racism mission](https://england.shelter.org.uk/were_committed_to_becoming_an_anti-racist_organisation) and our [2022-25 organisational strategy](https://england.shelter.org.uk/what_we_do/our_strategy)?
*   Have you started the project with a goal and a hypothesis? Discoveries should never start with a solution in mind.
*   The decisions we make must be based on user needs and other forms of evidence. Have you considered what user research might need to be done to inform your decisions? Check Shelter's [User Research Best Practice](https://shelteruk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ETS/pages/923697168/User+Research+at+Shelter+-+WIP?focusedCommentId=934969391). For questions contact [ux@shelter.org.uk](mailto:ux@shelter.org.uk).

### **User Experience Design:**

*   Have you ideated based on user insights rather than jumping to a single solution?
*   Our brand is a core element of how we align the design of our digital assets. Have you reviewed Shelter’s [Brand Guidelines](#)?
*   In order to provide an accessible and consistent experience across the whole of the Shelter website, we design using our UI kit. Have you reviewed the [Components](https://www.figma.com/file/yQ3f4QlPfY0pH576mbpyqp/Shelter-UI-Kit?node-id=1457%3A0) and [Standard Page Templates](https://www.figma.com/file/yQ3f4QlPfY0pH576mbpyqp/Shelter-UI-Kit?node-id=319%3A74) in Shelter’s UI kit? For questions, contact [ux@shelter.org.uk](mailto:ux@shelter.org.uk).
*   Have you followed [Shelter’s UI foundations](https://www.figma.com/file/vH0UlrkKDtDrgdJhDkwSS6/Shelter-UI-kit?node-id=866%3A0) and ensured your design is inline with our standards, including our grid, spacing and icons?

### **Service Design:**

*   Do you have a good understanding of the dependencies and risks associated with the current problem space and any intended changes?

### **User Research:**

*   Are you choosing the right method/approach to meet the objectives of the research?

### **Delivery and Product Management:**

*   Is your team writing and prioritising user stories?
*   Are you running sprint ceremonies such as stand-ups, planning and retrospectives?
*   Have you got the resources and budget to bring together and maintain a team that can offer the different skills required?
*   Do you have a good understanding of the various complexities, contexts and constraints in which you’re working?
*   Are your senior stakeholders aware of the project and it's aims, and bought into the team’s ways of working?

### **Content Design:**
