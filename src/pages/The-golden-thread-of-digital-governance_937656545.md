Shelter’s digital governance: A golden thread of strategic connection
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The graphic shows how our digital governance ensures that the charity’s high-level objectives are reflected in every piece of digital work.

**Shelter’s 3-year strategy:**

*   Contains our vision, purpose, and high level goals
    

**Digital Leadership Group (DLG):**

*   Articulates the strategy into product and service visions
    
*   Oversees performance
    
*   Aligns planning across the organisation
    

**Business owners:** (Who are also members of the DLG)

*   Give clearly-defined goals to their teams
    
*   Make approvals based on strategic intent
    

**Product managers:**

*   Take strategic direction from business owners and DLG
    
*   Goal-oriented roadmapping
    
*   Define problems to be solved
    
*   Plan approach, resource, and technology
    

**Product teams:** (Product and service teams as well as devolved self-publishing teams)

*   Keep strategic focus via roadmaps and goal statements
    
*   Research, design, and development
    
*   Testing unknowns
    
*   Scaling and deployment
    

**Content managers and service owners:**

*   Take strategic direction from their business owners
    
*   Maintaining, measuring, and optimising
    
*   Monitoring, analysing, and reporting
    

**Executive Leadership Team (ELT):**

*   DLG escalates issues to them:
    
    *   Risks
        
    *   Competing priorities they haven’t resolved themselves
