Quotes from real people lend weight to Shelter’s communications. Add images to them and they become stronger still. Together, quotes and images are valuable storytelling content that gives our service users, supporters and others a voice. Which also provides the authenticity that is part of Shelter’s content strategy.

To create them, first you build each testimonial using **Data - testimonial**, then you bring them into an **Assembly - testimonial**.

**Creating a Data testimonial**
-------------------------------

1.  Start by using **Add entry** upper right in the content dashboard and select **Data - testimonial**  
    TIP: Quickly filter the list by typing the first three letters of what you need, eg **tes…**
    

1.  **Name** \- the system name CMS users will see
    
2.  **Testimonial image** \- use **Link existing asset** (or use **Create new asset and link** if you’ve done a thorough search and can’t find what you need. Read more about [uploading images to the media library](https://shelteruk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CDP/pages/191169731/Managing+images+and+other+assets+in+the+Media+library).

4\. **Testimonial text** - enter a quote from the person. You can include normal text, bold/italic, hyperlink, bulleted/numbered list, and an H3 if you want.

5\. **Testimonial author** - the person’s name. Consider whether to include their surname. Unless the person is someone well known such as an MP, the standard convention is to use only their first name.

6\. **Box background colour** - select grey or white. This is for the box which features the quote if the testimonial assembly is not set to **quote slider** (example to the right).

7\. **Publish** your testimonial

**Creating a testimonial assembly**
-----------------------------------

1.  Use **Add entry** to select **Assembly - testimonial**
    
2.  **Name** - the system name CMS users will see
    
3.  **Header text** - if you don’t make the assembly a quote slider, this will display above the testimonials as an H2. For a quote slider it won’t display.
    
4.  **Testimonials** - find and add the **Data - testimonial** entries you’ve just created it. Once added, click and drag the left edge of blocks to change their sequence.
    
5.  **Quote slider** - select **Yes** to display the testimonials as a series of single images and quotes with a toggle arrow the users clicks to see the series. [See our FOSH page](https://website-assets-6434318868.gtsb.io/support_us/campaigns/a_vision_for_social_housing) for an example.
    
6.  **Publish** the assembly. It’s now ready to be added to pages.
    

### **NOTE: Controlling image height**

Unlike most of other components and assemblies that allow images, the quote slider does not stay with a fixed viewport (eg image height and width never change). The viewport height will adjust to fit the image:
