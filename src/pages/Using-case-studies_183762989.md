## Where to find stories and photos  

- Shelter staff can find case study stories and photos on [Story House](https://imagehouse.shelter.org.uk/login.php?url=%2Fpages%2Fhome.php&nocookies=true)
- You don’t need to request a login – just click on the red **Shelter staff login** button on [the homepage](https://imagehouse.shelter.org.uk/login.php?url=%2Fpages%2Fhome.php&nocookies=true) and it will take you straight through

## Photos of case studies  

- Images of case studies should be used with their own story, and not paired with new or different stories or quotes
- If there are no photos of a case study to go with their story, please use a model image instead and include the disclaimer: ‘This is a real story, but models have been used to protect the privacy of our clients’
- For digital, if text and space are limited, consider using a footnote for the disclaimer. If this isn’t possible, then it's fine to leave it out in this context
- You can use an image of a case study in a general non-specific way, as long as there are no restrictions on the image. For example, a case study photo could be the hero image on a webpage about fighting homelessness, even if the case study's story isn't mentioned specifically on that page
- For more information about using case study photos, look at the Marketing team’s [rules for using photography](https://shelteruk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/inhouse/Documents/Brand/Using%20photographs%20rules_brand%20photography.docx?d=w00ae8d5ff0fe4920bf232976b2c3a36e&csf=1&e=B5Np7A)

## Videos of case studies

For case study videos to be effective, they need to follow a set of principles, for filmmaking and for our brand. Be sure to [read our video style notes](https://shelteruk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ETS/pages/630358245/Case+study+videos%3A+a+guide+for+partners+and+agencies).

## Quoting case studies  

- You don’t need to quote case studies word for word all the time
- As long as the meaning and tone remain the same, it is fine to:

  - paraphrase
  - shorten a quote
  - make it easier to understand
  - join two quotes together
  - change a word, if the wrong one has been used

- A quote should never be rewritten to include Shelter buzzwords. For example, ‘We need to end the housing emergency’.
