With Release 4 from June 2022, our digital framework focuses on a major element of our digital transformation: our **content operations**.

Content ops are the people, platforms and processes that give us the ability to deliver great content to our users, consistently - and do it at scale.

Our new content ops section
---------------------------

*   [What content operations are and why they’re important](960921601.html)
    
*   [Our content governance](Content-governance_962232329.html)
    
*   [Shelter’s content lifecycle](The-lifecycle-of-a-piece-of-content_962330631.html)
    
*   [How we decide what to do and what not to do](How-we-decide-what-to-do-and-what-not-to-do_962330638.html)
    
*   [Content and user journeys](Content-and-user-journeys_962297865.html)
    
*   [How to retire content - and how not to](Retiring-content-and-how-to-do-it-right_962199564.html)
    

Visit any of these pages or start at [the section’s homepage](Our-content-operations_960856065.html).

Also new in the framework
-------------------------

We’ve added a section for user-centred design, beginning with:

*   [an explanation of our design thinking](https://design.shelter.org.uk/digital-framework/design-thinking-at-shelter)
    
*   [a helpful checklist for anyone inside or outside of Shelter](https://design.shelter.org.uk/digital-framework/digital-checklist-for-partners-and-staff) who’s working on our digital products and services.
