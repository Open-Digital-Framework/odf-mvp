As an organisation, we send hundreds of emails every month, to dozens of different audiences. We send emails for fundraising, events, and campaigns, emails about services and products, or from our shops to their customers – the list goes on.

Our supporters receive regular email communications as part of our CRM Strategy, and additional communications, when necessary, outside of this.

Within these communications, we encourage people to take actions - for example, asking a supporter on a fundraising journey to donate to a Shelter shop, or take a campaign action. This means many of our supporters receive emails from lots of different teams across Shelter, so it’s important we’re consistent in how we speak to them.

This guide will help you create emails that are consistent, on-brand and effective. If you have any questions, please email [editorialallusers@shelter.org.uk](mailto:editorialallusers@shelter.org.uk).
