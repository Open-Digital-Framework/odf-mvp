**The way we look and sound shows people exactly who we are and what we believe in.**

Everyone has the right to a safe home and our brand will make sure that everyone knows this.  
It’ll inspire people to join us and let anyone facing a housing problem know that we’re on their side and we’ll protect their rights.

That’s why, instead of brand guidelines, you should think of this as a guide to helping us stand up to the housing emergency.
